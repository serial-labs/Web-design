                From the 16th century onward, heraldry became more fanciful as
                it detached from its military function.</span

                military service toward nobility defined in other ways.</span
              >
              Heraldic arms followed suit. Armies still used badges and
              insignia, but these went back to the old Roman idea of rank and
              allegiance to one's military group, rather individuals and
              families.

              Russia began to use formal heraldry in the 17th century. 20 South
              Africa dates its heraldic practice to Dutch heraldry from the same
              century. Nations rose that had not existed in medieval times, as
              well as organizations like the Society for Creative Anachronism,
              which seeks to recreate medieval customs and cultures.

            <span class="gras">
              Heraldry also began to be used for more than purposes of
              identifying noble families.</span

          They reflected national history rather than the history of one family.
          In addition, smaller units with a nation, even down to towns and
          villages, also made up coats of arms and badges. Some were even
          granted as far back as medieval times.

          Similarly, institutions like universities, colleges and secondary
          schools took coats of arms. Paramilitary groups like police
          departments and intelligence branches of government took badges, as
          well.

          German heralds had died out by the 18th century. 23 Professional
          heralds have been mostly replaced by amateur enthusiasts. However,
          colleges of heralds, like the British College of Arms, still exist.
          They have the authority to grant official coats of arms, as well as to
          give advice on how to continue inherited coats of arms
