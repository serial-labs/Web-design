                <p class="txtj"> <span class="gras"> The shield, or escutcheon as it is also known, has a surface area called a 
                  field and it is the central area on which symbols and figures are painted that represents a coat 
                  of arms. In some cases, people today referred to coat of arms as a family crest.</span> 
                  <span class="utility-text">You can select any shape that you wish for your shield, but bear in mind 
                  that historically, a knight's shield was generally square at the top and coming to a point at the bottom</span>
                  They could 
                  and by about the year 1250, the shields used in warfare were almost triangular in shape, referred to as heater 
                  shields. A lozenge or diamond shape shield was usually used by women who didn't go to war, or for clergy who did 
                  not go into battle.</p>

              <span class="utility-text">The shapes of shields have changed through time and have been adapted to the type of warfare or purpose that they served.</span>
              For example, the shield of a printer or a bakery guild is far different from that of a warrior's shield that was cut straight at the top to protect 
              the shoulders and chest area, and pointed at the bottom for easier mobility when sitting on a steed with knees up. To complete a knight's ensemble,
               the coat a knight wore over his armor would match the markings on the shield he carried, hence the derivation of the phrase "coat of arms."

                this area of a shield is painted or covered over first with a layer of colors - either single color, multi colors, or with 
                a symbolic fur representation that is applied over the surface or field. Single color or single fur shields are considered 
                to be predominant, those shields that have more than one tincture (color) as most do, include fields that are most often divided 
                or separated by partition lines that each have various names.</p>
