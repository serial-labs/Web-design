                Every army in history needed a way to distinguish it from the
                enemy. This was accomplished by markings on clothing, helmets,
                armor, or shields that set one army apart from the other.</span

              They could also advertise rank and were a way of boasting about
              identity- one's homeland, ancestry and exploits. The Greeks often
              bore images of animals on their shields to identify their home
              city state. The Athenians bore an owl, the Thebans a sphynx, and
              so on. These images represented a shorthand of an important,
              defining myth about their city state or its patron deity.

          It is believed that the Welsh dragon, a famous symbol in British
          heraldry, originally derived from the standard of a Roman legion
          posted in Wales 2. More like the heraldry of medieval times, the
          ancient Israelites carried banners that identified each tribe and
          Egyptian serekh emblems were used on trade goods to identify
          individual pharaohs. 3

          </span>
          The rules of today derive from regulations devised in early medieval
          northern Europe, mostly in France, England and the Holy Roman Empire,
          but their use extended as far east as Poland and as far south as
          Spain. Though heraldic arms first appeared during the reign of
          Charlemagne, true heraldic symbols that were passed down through noble
          families did not appear until the 12th century. 4 Heraldry began as a
          strictly military insignia for rulers and their dynasties. The
          Anglo-Norman term, "herald" derives from the Germanic
          <span class="utility-text">"harja-waldaz"</span> which means "military
          commander." The practice soon spread to the nobility, from high to
          low. From the mid-14th century onward, it also began to be used by
          rich non-nobles in non-military settings.

                >
                This skill became so valuable that even smaller military groups
                and minor nobles employed a herald when going to battle.

                >
                The warrior class also began to recognize a need to distinguish
                individuals and join groups under one symbol during the
                Crusades, when large groups from different parts of Europe
                fought for one cause.

              their arms as they pleased.</span
            >
            Rules for heraldry soon began to develop when different people used
            similar images, making it difficult to tell them apart. Another need
            for rules grew up from the practice of joining arms onto one shield
            to show acquisition of lands through marriage or important
            parentage. In addition, multiple sons required slight variations in
            the family shield to distinguish each one. Rules arose with the
            development of the heralds, who identified armory (the objects on
            which the symbols were placed) within the general field of heraldry
            (the practices and rituals surrounding the use of the symbols).
