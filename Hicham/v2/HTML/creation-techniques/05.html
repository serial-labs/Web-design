            The road map to discovery of the meaning of a coat of arms can be like
            finding and opening up a treasure chest! By understanding the symbols
            and the meaning behind them, we can literally understand the purpose
            of the coat of arms that after all was begun in order to identify the
            bearer of the arms!

            <span class="utility-text"
              >The key to this identification was the image placed on the field.
              Traditionally, charges fall into two groups: animate and inanimate.
              The animate would consist of a whole host of birds, beasts, be they
              real or of mythical proportion. The inanimate would be objects we
              are all familiar with, or tools of trade.</span
            >
            Sometimes these charges were more symbolic in nature and could be
            considered puns, playing upon the bearer's name and became known as
            "Canting arms". For our modern day purposes, more abstract ideas and
            symbols are fine to use as well. Remember that the possibilities for
            your coat of arms are vast and it can be exciting to create your very
            own. First, let's look at a few interesting charges such as:

            <h4 class="gras txtc">POULTRY</h4>
            <p>
              Birds of all kinds have been displayed on shields beginning with
              the gentle dove, the symbol of peace and the rooster synonymous
              with the proud heritage of France. Geese as we know choose mates
              for life and are popular symbols of fidelity. The peacock is the
              proud bearer of gorgeous plume and coveted for his beauty. The
              swan is another charge often used in heraldry to symbolize war and
              peace and sometimes serenity and fidelity since they too mate for
              life. Ducks can elude their enemies in many ways, either by
              flying, running, swimming or diving for cover and therefore they
              are a symbol for a person of many resources. Ducks may be referred
              to by many names such as drake, mallard, teal, eiderduck, moorhen,
              and sheldrake.

            <h4 class="gras txtc">FISH</h4>
            <p>
              Almost any fish can be used in heraldry, but the dolphin is the
              most often recognized one as in the example of the arms of the
              Dauphin of France. This play on words is known as a "cant" in
              heraldic terms. Other fish found often are the pike, salmon, and
              trout. We find eels for the name Ellis, trout for Troutbeck,
              gudgeon for the French family of Goujon, and a dolphin between
              three ears of wheat for John Fyshar ("fish-ear"), Bishop of
              Rochester.

            <p>
              Swords are symbols for a warrior and are emblems for military
              honor and virtue. The sword is also emblematic of liberty and
              strength and if it is borne with flames, it is also a symbol of
              purification. Two swords crossed in saltire is an emblem of Saint
              Andrew, one of Christ's apostles and the brother of Saint Peter.
              Daggers and knives are used often as well, not only for military
              symbolism but also for professional purposes such as
              blacksmithing, fencing and the like.

            <p>
              Charges of ships are often seen in heraldry. They symbolize some
              notable expedition by sea perhaps of the first owner of the coat
              of arms. The single-mast galley known as the Lymphad seem to be
              the most prevalent and of Scottish origin. There are also full
              sailing ships, pirate ships, Viking ships and many more. If a ship
              is borne without a mast it is said to denote tragedy at sea. The
              ship was also an early symbol of the church as a place where the
              voyagers of faith could gather and sail over the rough areas of
              life to the good destination God had for them.

            <p>
              Generally, keys are thought of as the emblems of guardianship and
              dominion or of confinement and release. It is also involved with
              the idea of liberation, knowledge, mystery, and initiation. Silver
              (Argent) keys usually are thought of as objects of earthly power,
              while Gold (Or) keys refer to power of a more spiritual nature. In
              Christianity, the key is symbolic of St. Peter, considered to be
              the guardian of the gates of heaven and a symbol of knowledge and
              of guardianship, and of dominion. Two keys crossed is the emblem
              of St. Peter who holds the keys to these gates. This emblem is
              also part of the insignia of His Holiness the Pope.

              symbolizes manifestation; if closed, counsel; usually represents
              the bible. A book is most often a representation of a scholarly
              coat of arms. Books are also considered a symbol of learning. Many
              heraldry experts frequently mention that the Bible is the book
              represented in a coat of arms.

            <p>
              Feathers are a very common charge in heraldry, which is not
              surprising considering that during a tournament helmets were more
              frequently ornamented with feathers than with family crests.
              Consequently the plume that is a grouping of five feathers became
              the actual, inheritable family crest for many families. Feathers
              signify willing obedience and serenity of mind.

            <h4 class="gras txtc">PLANTS</h4>
            <p>
              The broom plant is a symbol of humility. A sprig of this shrub was
              chosen as the badge of the royal house of Plantagenet, who are
              said to have derived their surname from the circumstance of one of
              their ancestors having worn a branch of broom is his helmet either
              because of penance, or in token of humility. So often we find
              trees, shrubs and flowers placed on coat of arms. A tree can
              depict the tree of life and humanity. A pine tree for example,
              sometimes symbolizes long-suffering, steadfast friendship, and
              enduring fame. Holly also was used to adorn temples and sacred
              places and its name is derived from the word holy. Holly is an
              emblem of truth. In ancient times, laurel leaves were thought to
              be remedies against poison as well as tokens of peace and quiet.
              They are symbolic of triumph and fame, especially when it is
              gained after a long, inner struggle. Finally, a palm tree
              symbolizes righteousness, resurrection, and victory. On a side
              note, it may also indicate that the bearer served or fought in a
              tropical country.

              The griffin is a mythical creature, with the head, wings and
              talons of an eagle and the body and hind legs of a lion. It is
              thus composed of the most royal of the birds and the beasts. The
              griffin was thought to find and guard mines of gold and hidden
              treasures. It signifies valor, death-defying bravery, strength,
              vigilance, and perseverance. A male griffin has no wings but often
              has horns and a spiky tail. It is often seen spelled gryphon. A
              dragon is supposed to have a keen sight, which enables it to guard
              treasures so well. It is also said to be the most valiant of
              creatures; therefore, the dragon is a symbol of a most valiant
              defender of treasure. Dragons are perceived as powerful,
              protective, and fearsome, and they are valued for their warlike
              qualities. The wyvern, or wivern is a mythical beast with the
              upper part of a dragon, two legs and a body that curves into the
              tail of a serpent. It symbolizes valor and protection. Like the
              dragon, the wyvern is supposed to have a keen sense of sight,
              which enabled it to guard treasures. The bearer of this symbol may
              have been a keen defender, or was thought to have slain a wyvern.
              It is also a symbol of vengeance or perseverance.
