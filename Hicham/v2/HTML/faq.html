              <h3>Questions about blazons, coats of arms & heraldry</h3>
            </div>
            <div id="s1q1">
              <p>What is a blazon?</p>
              <p>
                A blazon is the formal description of a coat of arms, flag or
                other emblem - a visual image put into words. Anyone familiar
                with heraldic terminology can read a blazon and accurately
                reconstruct the image it describes. Blazons were standardized in
                the 13th century and are written in anglicized version of Norman
                French, which can take some getting used to: “argent a cross
                Gules” (a silver background with a red cross) is the blazon of
                England, for example.

            <div id="s1q2">
              <p>What is a coat of arms?</p>
              <p>
                A coat of arms – or simply “arms” - is a distinctive arrangement
                of symbols officially recognized as the emblem of an individual,
                family, institution or country. The design of each coat of arms
                is unique and highly symbolic, revealing the values of the
                person, or group of people, it represents.
              </p>

            <div id="s1q3">
              <p>
                What is the difference between a coat of arms and a blazon ?
              </p>
              <p>
                A blazon is the text that describes a coat of arms. Behind every
                coat of arms is a blazon setting out the colors, symbols and
                patterns that must be used. It's important to remember that a
                blazon never changes, while the coat of arms it describes can
                have many variations in style and presentation.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="separatorh m1"></div>

            <div id="s1q4">
              <p>What is heraldry?</p>
              <p>
                Heraldry is simply the profession, art or study of blazons and
                the coats of arms they describe. It also refers to the process
                by which blazons are formally registered and granted. The
                practice of heraldry is almost 900 years old, but many of its
                conventions developed during Victorian times where there was a
                revival of interest in coats of arms.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="separatorh m1"></div>

            <div id="s1q5">
              <p>Why do I need a blazon?</p>
              <p>
                Blazons were first used by medieval knights to identify
                themselves in battle or tournament, but soon spread to all
                sections of society. Today, having a coat of arms - or the
                blazon that describes it - is like having your own personal
                logo. And it's a great way to learn about European cultural
                history too.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="separatorh m1"></div>

            <div id="s1q6">
              <p>Can anyone have a blazon?</p>
              <p>
                Yes! Anyone can have their own blazon, no matter what their
                occupation, background or location. And it's not just
                individuals or families – towns, cities, countries, societies,
                sports clubs and corporations can all have their own unique
                blazon too.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="separatorh m1"></div>

            <div id="s1q7">
              <p>Do I have to be "noble" to wear a coat of arms?</p>
              <p>
                Of course not! It's true that in the early days of heraldry
                coats of arms wore worn chiefly by knights from so-called
                “noble” families. But the trend soon spread to all parts of
                society, with craftsmen, peasants and many others devising their
                own blazon. Today, coats of arms are adopted by people from all
                backgrounds.

            <div class="separatorh m1"></div>

            <div id="s1q8">
              <p>When did people begin wearing coats of arms?</p>
              <p>
                We can be quite precise about that: the tradition began in
                Europe some time between 1130 and 1150. Intriguingly, the
                wearing of coats of arms appeared at the same time in many
                places of Europe - a fact which has puzzled historians.

            <div id="s1q9">
              <p>What is the origin of the symbols used in coats of arms?</p>
              <p>
                The traditional symbols of heraldry come from the geometric
                shapes knights painted on their shields to identify themselves
                on the battlefield, since they were impossible to recognize
                under their heavy armor.

                Not usually, but there are official heraldic authorities you
                should consult if you want to be absolutely sure your blazon is
                unique. The situation varies form country to country – in
                England and Wales, for instance, there still exists a High Court
                of Chivalry which has settled disputes over the use of heraldic
                arms since the 14th century, but such cases are very rare today.

              <p>Can I have the same blazon as someone else?</p>
              <p>
                Ideally your blazon will be unique – after all, that's the point
                of a coat of arms! But it's not quite that simple. If two people
                have the same blazon but live in different countries, for
                instance, it's very unlikely to cause any confusion.

              <p>Can a group of people (eg a sports team) have a blazon?</p>
              <p>
                Of course! Many sports teams wear coats of arms on their shirts,
                particularly soccer teams in the UK. Towns, cities and countries
                also have their own blazons, as do institutions, corporations
                and societies.

              <p>How is a blazon created?</p>
              <p>
                The system by which coats of arms are designed is called
                “heraldry”. It's a set of strict rules about the tinctures
                (colors), shapes and symbols that can be used in a blazon. The
                rules may seem restrictive, but they allow experts to recreate
                any coat of arms just from its description.

              <p>What is a shield?</p>
              <p>
                The shield is the most important and symbolic element of a coat
                of arms. The term and its shape come from heraldry’s military
                origins, when knights used to bear their blazon on their
                shields. Various other heraldic components - such as supporters,
                crests, mantling and a motto - can be added to the shield to
                create what's known as a full “achievement”. To learn more about
                heraldic shields read our

              <p>What is a tincture?</p>
              <p>
                Tincture simply means color or pattern. Remember, blazons are
                written in a specialized language derived from Norman French, so
                “gold” becomes “or” and “blue” becomes “azur”. Tinctures can
                also describe patterns found in animal fur, such as ermine.

              <p>What is a charge?</p>
              <p>
                A charge is any symbol used in the shield of a coat of arms.
                Hundreds of different charges are used in heraldry: geometric
                designs (called “ordinaries”), people, body parts, animals,
                plants, flowers, weapons, religious symbols – in fact, pretty
                much any object that's associated with the wearer. To learn more

            <div id="s1q17">
              <p>Why are blazons written is such a strange language?</p>
              <p>
                Blazons are written using an anglicized form of Norman French,
                which reflects heraldry's origins in 12th century Europe. That's
                why it sounds like a strange mixture of Latin, French and
                English. Once you get used to it, however, it's very clear and
                concise.

              <p>What colors can I use in my coat of arms?</p>
              <p>
                Apart from a few rare exceptions, just five colors (called
                “tinctures”) are used in heraldry: gules (red), azur (blue),
                vert (green), sable (black) and purpure (purple). There are also
                two “metal” colors: or (yellow) and argent (white). To learn

              <p>What kinds of charges can I use in my coat of arms?</p>
              <p>
                There are almost no limits on the kinds of charges that can
                feature in coats of arms - from the most traditional “lion
                rampant”, favored by many of Europe's royal houses, to a plane
                used by a region famous for its aeronautical industry.

              <p>What drawing style should I use ?</p>
              <p>
                Coats of arms are traditionally drawn in a highly stylized
                fashion that developed in the 18th and 19th centuries. But
                you'll find lots of variation today – think of Peugeot's lion,
                for example, which was once depicted in the traditional heraldic
                style but is now a highly modernistic design. The really
                important thing is to ensure the image is an accurate reflection
                of its blazon.

              <p>Is the Hogwarts coat of arms in Harry Potter real?</p>
              <p>
                The coat of arms used by Hogwarts, the fictional school in JK
                Rowling's Harry Potter books, follows proper heraldic
                conventions. It depicts each house's mascot – a lion, serpent,
                eagle and badger – against its color. There is a long tradition
                of fictional and legendary characters being given their own
                coats of arms - King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table,
                for example. Medieval artists even gave Jesus Christ his own
                coat of arms, usually based on the instruments of the passion.

              <p>Do I need to be logged in to Facebook to use MyBlazon?</p>
              <p>
                Yes you do. MyBlazon is a Facebook application so you'll need to
                be logged in. A web version will be available soon.

                Why would I need to purchase a high definition image of my coat
                of arms?
              </p>
              <p>
                We strongly recommend that you use high definition image if you
                want to print your coat of arms. A standard definition image
                will look pixelated and blurry.
              </p>

            <div class="separatorh m1"></div>

            <div id="s2q22">
              <p>How do I purchase a high definition version?</p>
              <p>
                That's easy – just go to the “download and share” page and click
                on the “download HD” button. A Facebook payment popup will then
                open. Once your payment has been processed you can download your
                design as many times as you like.

            <div id="s2q23">
              <p>
                Do I have to buy another high definition image if I edit my coat
                of arms?
              </p>
              <p>
                Once you've purchased the high definition image of your blazon
                you can edit and download it as many times as you like. However,
                if you create a new blazon - through the “create new
                coat-of-arms” process - you'll need to purchase a new high
                definition image for that coat of arms.

                Yes! You can download the high definition version and then use

              </p>
              <p>
                No, all products in our Zazzle store are automatically printed
                with a high definition version of your blazon. However, if you
                want to use another printing service you will need to purchase
                your own high definition image.
